# 04_variables
    are names that we give to certain value in our programs
# Expression
    An expression is a
    combination of numbers, symbols or other variables that produce a result when evaluated. In this example, we are    
    multiplying the value of two variables to arrive at
    the value that we want.


# Variables restrictions.
    First, you shouldn't use
    as variable names any of the key words or
    functions that Python reserves for its own, like print. Using these reserved
    terms will make your program confusing to read
    and will result in errors. Python also has some
    restrictions on the characters you can
    use to define a variable. Variable names can't have
    any spaces and they must start with either a
    letter or an underscore. Also, they can only be made up of letters, numbers
    and underscores. Let's check out some examples of valid and invalid variable names to understand this better. I_am_a_variable is the
    valid variable name. I_am_a_variable2 is also
    a valid variable name. 1_is_a_number is invalid because variable names must start
    with a letter or underscore. Apples_&_oranges
    is invalid because it uses the special
    character ampersand. Last thing, remember that precision is important
    when programming. Python variables are case sensitive, so
    capitalization matters. Lowercasename,
    uppercasename and ALLCAPSNAME are all valid
    and different variable names, and that rule on
    variables is invariable.
